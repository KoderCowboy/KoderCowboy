- 👋 Hi, I’m @KoderCowboy
 I work for a large corporation in BI development. Been using Qlik products for last 7 years or so and have developed apps (Management Dashboards) in Qlikview and Qlik Sense. 
 Most data tied in to our SAP ERP in our BW but I have also pulled data from other databases like SQL.  Also have experience automation of scheduled report delivery using 
 N-Printing, project publication, update and user management with Qlikview Management Console (QMC) and more recently rolling out Qlik Sense and managing data streams.  Hobbies 
 include debugging someone else's code, fixing broken things, troubleshooting, making enhancements and progressing presentation techniques.  I work in a global team and I am lucky 
 enough to work remotely most of the time.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the wonders of github, collabing with others using this platform
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python because I heard that is the right thing to do... plus I've always wanted to learn another language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in fighting evil
- 📫 How to reach me ... 867-5309, you can always light up the skylights
